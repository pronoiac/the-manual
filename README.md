# The Manual

[From Wikipedia:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Manual)
> *The Manual (How to Have a Number One the Easy Way)* is a 1988 book by "The Timelords" (Jimmy Cauty and Bill Drummond), better known as The KLF.
It is a step-by-step guide to achieving a No.1 single with no money or musical skills, and a case study of the duo's UK novelty pop No. 1 "Doctorin' the Tardis".

In January 2021, The KLF resurfaced, reissuing their music on streaming services and Youtube.

*The Manual* came up in the conversation around this, with someone noting that there were typos and OCR artifacts.
Copies have been floating around the net for ages, apparently based on the same source.
I thought, "oh, that should be a quick fix."

It took a bit more time than I expected, but I think it cleans up well:
